Project name: Quick Shop

This is my first full stack project and i'm so excited to tell you about it.

First reason of my excitement is... first time i have build a full stack project, though it was so difficult to me to apply every requirement and make it alive. But, at the end of the day i've done it ...

The Second reason is... it takes almost three days for building this app and it was so frustrating period to me to build a react app using router, react hooks, firebase authentication and many more complex methods of reactjs. After completing this project i took a deep breath.

By the way, it is an e-commerce web app. In the home page multiple categories of products are shown through cards.

here is the live link of this project.
